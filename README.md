# Apple-Inspired Scientific Calculator

A sleek, responsive web calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project is heavily inspired by the aesthetic and functionality of the **Apple Calculator app**, featuring a clean dark-mode interface, glowing button variants, and an interactive panel that lets you switch between a basic and an advanced scientific layout.

## Features

- **Apple-Inspired Design:** Clean dark-mode background, rounded button typography, and recognizable color coding (iconic orange for basic operators, gray for numbers, and deep slate for advanced options).
- **Interactive Advanced Toggle:** Toggles seamlessly between a basic 4-operation layout and an expanded 5-row scientific grid with a single click—mimicking the iPhone's portrait-to-landscape layout shift.
- **Glowing Visual Accents:** Customized neon box-shadow highlights that make the active buttons and text input fields pop.
- **Secure Expression Evaluation:** Instead of step-by-step memory clearing, the app reads, sanitizes, and evaluates the entire string expression directly from the screen using safe, sandboxed evaluation logic.
- **Robust Input Handling:** Configured with a responsive layout text display that smoothly adapts to long equations and prevents invalid mathematical characters.

## Supported Operations

* **Basic:** Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`×`), Division (`÷`), Percent (`%`), and Positive/Negative toggles (`+/-`).
* **Advanced/Scientific:** 
  * Parentheses `(` and `)` for operation sequencing.
  * Trigonometry: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, and Radian controls.
  * Powers & Roots: $x^2$, $x^3$, $x^y$, $e^x$, $10^x$, $\frac{1}{x}$, $\sqrt{x}$, $\sqrt[3]{x}$, $\sqrt[y]{x}$.
  * Logarithms & Math Constants: `ln`, `log₁₀`, e, and π.
  * Memory Keys: `mc`, `m+`, `m-`, `mr`.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic architecture, data-attribute mapping for mathematical conversion, and crisp structural layout.
- **CSS3:** Native CSS Grid configuration (10x5 multi-row layout), custom variable sizing, system font stacks, and responsive layout spacing.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Event delegation handlers, conditional text matching, string sanitation, and secure custom execution.
